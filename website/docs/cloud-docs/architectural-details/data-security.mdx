# Data Security

Terraform Cloud takes the security of the data it manages
seriously. This table lists which parts of the Terraform Cloud and Terraform Enterprise app can contain sensitive data, what storage is used, and what encryption is used.

### Terraform Cloud and Enterprise

## Vault Transit Encryption

The [Vault Transit Secret Engine](/vault/docs/secrets/transit)
handles encryption for data in-transit and is used when encrypting data from the
application to persistent storage.

## Blob Storage Encryption

All objects persisted to blob storage are symmetrically encrypted prior to being
written. Each object is encrypted with a unique encryption key. Objects are
encrypted using 128 bit AES in CTR mode. The key material is processed
through the [Vault transit secret engine](/vault/docs/secrets/transit),
which uses the default transit encryption cipher (AES-GCM with a 256-bit AES key
and a 96-bit nonce), and stored alongside the object. This pattern is called envelope encryption.

The Vault transit secret engine's
[datakey generation](/vault/api-docs/secret/transit#generate-data-key) creates the encryption key material using bit material from the kernel's cryptographically secure pseudo-random
number generator (CSPRNG) as the `context` value. Blob storage encryption generates a unique key for each object and relies on envelope encryption, so Vault does not rotate the encryption key material for individual objects. The root encryption keys within the envelope encryption scheme are rotated automatically by Terraform Cloud every 365 days. These keys are not automatically rotated within TFE.
